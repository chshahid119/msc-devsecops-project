backend api end points:

Backend (FastAPI)

/api/workflow-runs — paginated runs (with caching & safe token handling)

/api/workflow-run/{run_id} — single run raw details

/api/workflow-run-full/{run_id} — run + jobs + logs (all in one)

/api/workflow-jobs/{run_id} — jobs for a run

/api/logs/{job_id} — job logs (fetched & returned as text)

standardized JSON responses, basic error handling, simple in-memory TTL cache
