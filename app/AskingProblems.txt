Question: When Our CI pipeline created a Docker image does it uploaded automatically on Repo?
Answer: No — it **does not get uploaded automatically** to your GitHub repository.  

Here’s why:  

---

### **1️⃣ What happens in the CI pipeline**

When your workflow runs:

```bash
docker build -t devsecops-demo-api ./app
```

- Docker reads your `Dockerfile` and **builds an image locally** on the GitHub Actions runner.  
- That image **only exists inside the temporary runner VM**.  
- After the workflow finishes, the runner is destroyed and the image disappears.

---

### **2️⃣ Why it doesn’t appear in your repo**

- Your GitHub repo only stores **files** (code, Dockerfile, configs, docs).  
- Docker images are **binary artifacts**, not plain files — GitHub repos are not meant to store them.  
- The `Dockerfile` is just a **text recipe**, not the image itself.  

---

### **3️⃣ How to make the image available**

If you want the image to persist or be reusable:

1. **Push to a Docker registry** (preferred):

   - Docker Hub: `docker push yourusername/devsecops-demo-api:latest`  
   - GitHub Container Registry: `ghcr.io/username/devsecops-demo-api:latest`  
   - AWS ECR: `aws ecr push ...`

2. **Save as a tar file and upload as CI artifact** (temporary, just for download):

```bash
docker save devsecops-demo-api -o devsecops-demo-api.tar
```

Then use `actions/upload-artifact` to upload that tar.

---

### ✅ Key takeaway

- **CI builds the image, but GitHub repo is not automatically updated.**  
- If you want it automatically available after CI, you must **push it to a registry** as part of your workflow.

Ah, yes — let me clarify exactly what happens when you run this step in your GitHub Actions workflow:

---

## **1️⃣ Where is the Docker image stored?**

When you run:

```bash
docker build -t devsecops-demo-api .
```

* GitHub Actions builds the Docker image **inside the runner VM** (the temporary Ubuntu machine).
* **It is not automatically pushed to GitHub or any external registry**.
* The image only exists **temporarily on that runner** and is gone when the runner shuts down after the job finishes.

So the “artifact” step you added:

```yaml
- name: Upload Docker Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: devsecops-demo-api
    path: ./app/Dockerfile
```

* **Does not save the built Docker image**.
* It only uploads the **Dockerfile** (the text file), **not the actual image**.
* If you want to save the actual Docker image, you need to either:

  1. Push it to a **Docker registry** (like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or GitHub Container Registry).
  2. Save it as a **tar file** and then upload it as an artifact:

```bash
docker save devsecops-demo-api -o devsecops-demo-api.tar
```

Then in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Upload Docker Image Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: devsecops-demo-api
    path: ./app/devsecops-demo-api.tar
```

---

## **2️⃣ Does the image automatically update in GitHub repository?**

* **No** — your GitHub repository stores only your **source code**, not Docker images.
* Building a Docker image locally or in CI **does not modify your repo**.
* To have the image persist for later use, you must **push it to a registry**. For example:

```bash
# Tag the image for Docker Hub
docker tag devsecops-demo-api yourdockerhubusername/devsecops-demo-api:latest

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push yourdockerhubusername/devsecops-demo-api:latest
```

* After this, anyone (or any deployment pipeline) can pull the latest image using:

```bash
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/devsecops-demo-api:latest
```

| Is it saved in GitHub repo automatically?    | No, the repo only stores code, not Docker images.                                       |
| How to persist it?                           | Push to Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry, or save as a tar file artifact. |
| Does workflow auto-update the image in repo? | No, you must configure a push step to a registry.                                       |

If you want, I can **update your GitHub Actions workflow** so that after every successful CI run it **pushes the Docker image to GitHub Container Registry automatically**, making it persistent and ready for Week 4/5 deployment.

Do you want me to do that next?
